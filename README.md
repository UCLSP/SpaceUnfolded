# Space Unfolded
Space Unfolded is a single point-of-view projector calibration system.
It is an OpenCV-based solution for correcting projected images to the shape of the projection area.

Example capture and calibration process can be found inside [the examples folder.](examples/SimpleCalibrationInPython)

Below we can see the calibration effects we can expect when using this solution on a room corner.
